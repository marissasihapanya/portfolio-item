- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Before I can fully interpret user needs and implement them into a program I'm developing, I need to talk with the user first.
Through my discussions with the user I can take notes. With these notes, I can develop "user stories" that'll give us direction
in our product development process. Following the same structure as "As an end user... I want to... so that I can..." will allow
me to have straightforward user stories as great guides. As I develop the program I can continuously discuss my progress
with the user and we can share critiques. Then I can continuously mold and transform our program through our focus on the customer.

I now know how to approach developing programs with an agile mindset. I should embrace change from the start. 
Then I need to break down the program into smaller, manageable pieces, and split my work into sprints.
For each of these sprints I'll create stories with the goal of finishing a specific piece of the program.
At the end of each sprint, I'll assess what I've completed and note what I haven't completed. Then I can reflect on what went well,
what went wrong, and my action items for the next sprint for improvement. 

A good team member is one who knows how to communicate, and communicates often. Through communication you can enforce and ensure
collaboration. They try their very best to deliver what they promise to. And if they do fall short of that, they take accountability, 
reflect, and actively try to do better. Most importantly, they're friendly and genuinely caring. A rapport between all the teammates
is essential to a fantastic team with great team members in software development.
